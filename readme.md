# CSPB 2270 â€“ Data Structures - Term Project

Description:
This data structure is an implementation of a Merkle Hash Tree. A Merkle Hash Tree is an efficient way to compare sets of data to ensure that they are identical. This is very useful when ensuring data transferred has been completely transferred and not tampered with. Another use case is ensuring that data sets that are stored on multiple servers stay up to date and identical with one another.

The data structure works by creating leaf nodes that contain the data (files, folders, transaction information, etc), creating a hash of that data with a hash function, combining two leaf node hashes and creating a new hash, and continuing up the tree structure until a top hash is reached. This top hash can be compared to top hashes of other data sets to determine if they are identical. If the hashes are different, then the data sets are different.

For this implementation, the data is a vector of strings. The Hash Tree class has member functions which allow the user to add data to the data set, create a hash tree from the data set, compare two data sets to determine if they are identical, and a hash function to return the hash value of a single key.

Instructions:
To compile the code, navigate to the build file and run the command make in the terminal. That will compile the code. The public member functions can then be called to compare data sets, build a hash tree, hash a value, or add a value to the data vector.

The input data for this hash tree class is a vector of string data.
